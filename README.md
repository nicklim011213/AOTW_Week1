# AOTW_Week1

## Explanation and rules

AOTW is a recurring series I would like to try. The acronym stands for **App Of The Week**.
The premise is very simple: every week, I have a new assignment—an application of some sort.
The first few days are spent ensuring that the most basic functions of the app are acceptable.
This is the end goal. Once the main end goal has been reached, I add stretch goals.

**I must make at least one commit a day**, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday, which are optional.

## This week’s app is: :sparkles: a P2P chat system. :sparkles:
The base goal is to **send and receive messages** between users using an **IP and a port**.
Stretch goals will be added once the base functions are ready.

**Stretch goals will be added here:**  
(None so far)
